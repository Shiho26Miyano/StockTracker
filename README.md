    A[User requests stock data (ticker, period)] --> B[Call yfinance: Ticker(ticker).history(period)]
    B --> C{Is DataFrame empty?}
    C -- No --> D[Return stock data to user]
    C -- Yes --> E[Log warning: No data for ticker/period]
    E --> F[Try alias ticker (e.g., GOOGL -> GOOG)]
    F --> G[Call yfinance: Ticker(alias).history(period)]
    G --> H{Is DataFrame empty?}
    H -- No --> I[Return alias stock data to user]

- Market data may be delayed by 15-20 minutes
